I wanted to make this page to outline some of the sources that I use frequently in the lessons and addendums for BU Quantum. 

While I list one-off sources in the notes pages themselves, these sources are used consistently throughout multiple lessons, so I am listing them here for convenience. 

They are also just really helpful resources that I constantly rely upon when refreshing myself on quantum algorithms.

The first is Peter Shor's quantum computing [lecture notes](https://math.mit.edu/~shor/435-LN/). Professor Shor teaches a class at MIT on quantum computing, and has made some of his lecture notes public. This is a really cool and useful resources to learn about quantum algorithms, particularly from a mathematical perspective, from perhaps the top expert in the field. 

While I draw upon his notes covering the fundamentals as well, I particularly use his notes on the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, Simon's algorithm, QFT, phase estimation, and Shor's algorithm.

Another resource I consistently use, particularly in later lessons, is Pennylane's [demonstrations](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demonstrations). These are really cool and offer a computational perspective to a lot of these algorithms at an advanced level. While I chose not to use the Pennylane SDK during the lessons, as I felt it would be a bit too much for beginners, their articles are super useful. I particularly use the demos on Grover's algorithm, QFT, phase estimation, and VQE.

Another resource I want to highlight is [IBM Quantum Learning](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en), which provides robust tutorials on many different subjects in quantum computing in Qiskit, which is the main SDK we will be using as part of the lessons. I primarily draw on the notes on the fundamentals, but I also use the VQE notes.

A more advanced but great resource is the [Classiq library](https://github.com/Classiq/classiq-library), which provides documentation on a bunch of quantum algorithms using the Classiq SDK, which is a more scalable and perhaps more intuitive tool for programmers. I really like Classiq, and we will use it in one of the lessons, but it is a resource I consider a bit more advanced to use due to some of its abstractions.

Lastly, other than some one-off articles or papers I mention in the lessons or addendums themselves, I rely on my own research and experience in designing the content. For example, I worked on the [glued trees algorithm](https://github.com/adam-godel/glued-trees) for Classiq, which comprises a major part of week 10 as a case study.

My primary aim for BU Quantum was to create something where you get out of it as much as you put in, very suitable for a club with a weekly workshop model. 

If you want to keep up with each weekly lesson and its corresponding addendum, you will get a detailed mathematical and computational understanding of quantum computing by the end of the semester. 

If you just want to look at a few lessons, you'll get a good sense of what quantum computing is like and if it (or what parts of it) is fit for you.

Regardless of how you approach this club, I hope you can gain something useful out of it, and gain an understanding for this growing, somewhat underappreciated, and often misconceived field.
